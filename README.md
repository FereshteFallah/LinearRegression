# LinearRegression

The MPG (Miles Per Gallon) dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning that relates to cars and their various features. This dataset is typically used for regression analysis and predicting the fuel consumption of cars. It contains features such as engine type, number of cylinders, horsepower, car weight, and other attributes that help in predicting fuel consumption.

Main Features of the MPG Dataset:
mpg: Fuel consumption of the car (miles per gallon).
cylinders: Number of cylinders in the engine.
displacement: Engine displacement (usually in cubic inches).
horsepower: Engine horsepower (in horsepower units).
weight: Car weight (in pounds).
acceleration: Car acceleration (change in speed per second).
model_year: Year of the car's model.
origin: Country where the car was manufactured (USA, Europe, or Japan).
name: Name of the car model.


Why is the MPG Dataset Important?
This dataset is one of the first educational datasets for machine learning and regression algorithms.
Due to its simplicity and variety of features, it's suitable for testing and evaluating machine learning models.
It can be used to predict fuel consumption of cars or analyze the effect of different features on fuel consumption.
Examples of Analysis:
Predicting the fuel consumption of a car based on features like weight, number of cylinders, and horsepower.
Analyzing the relationship between features like horsepower and mpg, or weight and mpg.
